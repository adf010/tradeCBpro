CREATE ORDER
Create an order with a specified product_id (asset-pair), side (buy/sell), etc.

Example:
order_configuration
market_market_ioc
quote_size - Amount of quote currency to spend on order. Only applicable to BUY orders.

base_size - Amount of base currency to spend on order. Applicable to BUY or SELL orders.

Market BUY:
Do the defaults first: If you ENTER 1 for quote, that will be 1 USD. If DOGE is about $0.10/DOGE you should get about 9.9 DOGE after fee.

Market SELL:
Use defaults but change "BUY" to "SELL". If you ENTER a 1 for quote you will sell 1 DOGE .

Limit_gtc BUY:
Change order type to limit. ENTER 2 for quote/base amount for 2 DOGE. ENTER a limit price to a couple cents less than the bid/ask prices.

Limit_gtc SELL:
Change order type to limit. Change side to sell. ENTER 2 for quote/base amount for 2 DOGE. ENTER a limit price to a couple cents more than the bid/ask prices.

There are 3 stops for you to double check info. You can ignore the brackets and quotes. those are to keep the server happy :)
